                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The $Loot token plays a pivotal role in driving the Looted Network ecosystem.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">To maintain market stability and fairness, Looted Network has implemented a wallet limitation policy. Wallet holdings are capped at 2%, which prevents a single entity from exerting excessive control over the ecosystem. This limitation promotes a more balanced distribution of tokens and safeguards against potential market manipulation.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Looted Network operates through an innovative Endless Jackpot Contract, powered by Chainlink VRF. This contract ensures unparalleled fairness in determining the winners of the jackpots. Participants can increase their chances of winning by contributing to the Loot Box, as their contributions directly influence the outcome. Moreover, a 5% rake from each jackpot fuels $Loot staking, enhancing the Total Value Locked (TVL) and providing rewards to the community.<br></p>
